"""
The PEP8 convention: 
The standard Python library is conservative and requires limiting lines 
to 79 characters (and docstrings or comments to 72).
I therefore put the line using ' \ ' to respect this convention.
|-------------------------Max width of comments------------------------|
|-------------------------Max width of the code-------------------------------|

Limiting the required editor window width allows you to open multiple 
files side-by-side and works well when you use code review tools that 
present both versions in adjacent columns.


The use of docstrings can be described as abusive, but I remind you 
that this is to demonstrate a complete understanding of the code .
The choice of docstring instead of multi-line comments is only a 
question of readability of the code overloaded with annotations.

Importing only what is necessary reduces the loading in memory.
The second advantage resides in the fact of knowing the state of each 
variable (via pylint in VScode) when the code is updated.

And obliging to an additional rigor concerning the control of code.
